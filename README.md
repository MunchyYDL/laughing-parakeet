# Home-assignment

Only a quick React-app to show some code & code-style.

As I was short on time, this is not really a sample I'm proud of,
but I would like you to take a look at another React-app i coded
last year. https://github.com/MunchyYDL/probable-dollop.git

## Estimated times

- Machine setup - 30min
- Create project & repo - 30min
- Part 1 - Menu - 2h
